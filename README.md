# Alphabet-soup-solver
This is a code test where I had to create a program capable of finding any word no matter what direction it is in.
This proyect is built on HTML, CSS for the visual part and JavaScript for the functional part. The javascript code has the functions required by the test to create a row-by-row alphabet soup and to search for any words on the x and y axes in addition to the diagonals.

You can test the proyect here https://wordsearchsolverjmgh.netlify.app/
